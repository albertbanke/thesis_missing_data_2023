ADS Thesis Project

Welcome to my thesis project GitHub repo. Here you will find all utilized data (all files in the folders. HFI being the core data frame spanning across all analyses). Moreover, all the Jupyter Modelling notebooks are attached. Please see the corrected order from initial preprocessing to modelling (1. through 5.). 

This is a multiverse analysis of predictors of missingness. Linked here is a Streamlit dashboard built on top of the results to help visualize what features are the most important and consistent predictors of missingness across the variated data frames and cross-validations: https://albertbanke-thesis-missing-data-2023-app-ou02mg.streamlit.app/
